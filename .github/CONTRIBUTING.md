# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ˜„

Contributions are handled in the form of Pull Requests. You fork this repository, create a new branch, make relevant changes, and submit a Pull Request â€“ once that's done we'll be able to review your PRs and merge them to the master branch.

## How to contribute

#### Bugs in the documentation

It may be identifying a semantic, logical error or even if the examples in this documentation do not work. The documentation may be out of date or something. Correct and send the Pull Request.

#### Bugs in the code

If you don't know the language, then you can test it anyway and send an Issue to be corrected.

#### Formatting

[Format your commit titles likewise](https://gist.github.com/fariasmateuss/c8b3a2e1b8ae7c3cda520d0ac6e9e237)

- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
